Please keep in mind that while make-up assignments are available, all the information may not be fully conveyed through the assignment. Note that the weekend classes are skills that can't be learned through training so they cannot be made up through assignments. Finally, although these were created as make-up assignments, they are also great practice for those who want to work on their counseling skills and can be used as such.\r\n\r\n[T1 - Aug 1 - Training Overview | Basic Counseling Skills (OARS)] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/19NHNsXXjXxqMcX259GL64L_2DAROPiuuLHvUaBIS9XU/edit?usp=sharing)  \r\nT2 - Aug 25 - Tenants of Harm Reduction Counseling and Behavioral Change  \r\nT3 - Sept 8 - Defining Risk | Client-Centered Counseling  \r\nT4 - Sept 22 - Counseling Toolbox  \r\nT5 - Oct 6 - Anti-Oppression  \r\nT6 - Oct 20 - Beyond HIV (Drugs, STIs, Health Coverage and Referrals)  \r\nT7 - Nov 3 - DVSA  \r\nT8 - Nov 17 - Self-Care and Trigger Management  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
